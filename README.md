# glfw_opengl_cmake_template

A template for GLFW + GLEW + GLM + OpenGL projects that builds on Linux, Mac, and Windows using CMake.

GLFW, GLEW, and GLM are automatically downloaded from GitHub and compiled (in case of GLFW). There's no need to install any other libraries, except for Mesa and X11 (or Wayland) dev packages on Linux.
